Most of our services use official and trusted SSL/TLS certificates. For some services, we use self-signed certificates. These certificates are signed by the following Hacking-Lab CA chain. 

1. [Intermediate Certification Authority](./cacerts/vuln-land-intermediate-ca.crt)

## Hacking-Lab LiveCD
You can use whatever client operating system you want when solving Hacking-Lab challenges, riddles and puzzles. 

But may you prefer a virtual machine for this? Use [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/) or alternatively our free [Kali-Linux based Hacking-Lab LiveCD](https://github.com/Hacking-Lab/hl-livecd) that comes with some extensions we like. (e.g docker, editors, and more ...)

The Hacking-Lab LiveCD is having some extensions installed - but in the core it is pure `Kali`!
